There are number of users who purchase products online and make payment through various websites. There are multiple websites who ask user to provide sensitive data such as username, password or credit card details etc. often for malicious reasons. This type of websites is known as phishing website. Phishing attacks are becoming more common and sophisticated, putting Internet users at risk. While these assaults have shown robust to a wide number of counter measures presented by business, and research groups, deep learning algorithms look to be a viable option for discriminating between phishing and authentic websites. 
Integrate machine learning and ANN algorithms to accurately differentiate between authentic and phishing websites. 
Develop an open-source system for extracting features and maintaining an up-to-date dataset of phishing and genuine websites. 
Reduce the reliance on a vast number of features by selecting key characteristics supported by evidence. 
 Enhance the ability to protect internet users from phishing attacks by improving the accuracy of phishing detection.
